The base functions as a training grounds, as a scratchpad and as my demo space. 
I have created a short specification for each project. All projects contained here 
are for displaying basic usage of technologies and methods I am familiar with.

#### EventAnalysis - an event tracking and reporting system
eclipse, jdk1.7, cygwin, csv parsing, maven dependencies, separation of concerns: services, util classes, business classes, 
iterative state machine: events, generic extensible and reusable java code, joda time, try to avoid magic numbers: prefer 
constants, dry, atomic classes, inheritance and abstractions: reusability, prefer exceptions to return codes, refactoring, 
prefer self documenting code: meaningful method (and class) naming over heavy javadoc, minimal side effects per 
class or method, avoiding misleading and intention hiding classes and methods.

#### Reservation - a booking system - unfinished, wip
eclipse, jdk1.7, cygwin, mariadb, maven, relational databases, heavy jdoc, sql scripts, jetty, wicket, unit tests, 
separation of concerns: service layer, db access layer, ui layer.
