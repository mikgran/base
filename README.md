The base functions as a scratchpad and a technology demo space.

Over time I will add more projects here covering technologies that I am familiar with.

- EventAnalysis - a logistics tracking system  generic extensible java code

eclipse, jdk1.7, cygwin, csv parsing, maven dependencies, pom.xml, dependencies packaging to the same jar file, 
separation of concerns: services, util classes, business classss, iterative state machine: events, generic extensible 
and reusable java code, joda time, try to avoid magic numbers: prefer constants, dot, dry, atomic classes, inheritance 
and abstractions: reusability, prefer exceptions to return codes, refactoring, prefer self documenting code: meaningful 
method (and class) naming over heavy jdoc, minimal side effects per class or method, avoiding misleading and intention hiding.

- Reservation - a booking system - Unfinished

eclipse, jdk1.7, cygwin, mariadb, relational databases, sql scripts, jetty, wicket, unit tests.
