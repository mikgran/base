The base functions as a scratchpad and my demo space.

Over time I will add more projects here covering technologies that I am familiar with.

- EventAnalysis - a logistics tracking system - generic extensible java code

-- eclipse, jdk1.7, cygwin, csv parsing, maven dependencies, separation of concerns: services, util classes, business classes, 
iterative state machine: events, generic extensible and reusable java code, joda time, try to avoid magic numbers: prefer 
constants, dry, atomic classes, inheritance and abstractions: reusability, prefer exceptions to return codes, refactoring, 
prefer self documenting code: meaningful method (and class) naming over heavy javadoc, minimal side effects per class or method, 
avoiding misleading and intention hiding classes and methods.

- Reservation - a booking system - Unfinished

-- eclipse, jdk1.7, cygwin, mariadb, maven, relational databases, sql scripts, jetty, wicket, unit tests.
